// I couldn’t find a suitable definition for Pisano period so that I could make a
// naive algorithm. Well, it turns out, I was looking at the wrong place. The whole
// time, it was right in front of my eyes but I couldn’t see it. So, without further
// ado, here’s the definition. This was a very tricky one. I had to search a lot and
// read quite a few posts in the Course forum to understand the algorithm.
//
// The algorithm to compute the get_fibonacci_huge was given in the What To Do section.
// “Therefore, to compute, say, F(2015) mod 3 we just need to find the remainder of
// 2015 when divided by 8. Since 2015 = 251·8+7, we conclude that F(2015) mod 3 = F 7 mod 3 = 1.”
//  We just have to generalize it.
//
// First we need to find the remainder of F(n) divided by the length of Paisano
// period given m. To find the length of Paisano period for m, simply find the
// remainder of F(0) mod m to F(m*m) mod m and stop as soon as you encounter 01,
// as they indicate that the next iteration is being started, and return the length
// up to that point.
//
// Now, you only need to find the F(remainder), which is going to be a lot less than F(n) and simply return it.
